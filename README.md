# web-scraper-game
This is a game that scrapes quotes from https://quotes.toscrape.com/. I turned the contents into a guessing game in which the user is given a quote and is prompted to guess the author. The user is given hints each time they guess incorrectly, until three hints are used, or the user guesses correctly.
